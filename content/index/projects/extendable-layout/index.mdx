This is a quick spike website to demo how easy it is to use ML5 tensorflow.js and video playback recognition. The site is a blank shell that is mobile and desktop friendly, using the user's camera to pull a live feed and run it through an image library (mobilenet) to give an automatic classifier for image recognition (will not work with people/faces or with lots of background 'noise').
